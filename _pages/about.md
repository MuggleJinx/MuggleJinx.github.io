Hi this is Xiaotian, a STAT PhD student at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), in [Stochastic Processes and Applied Statistics](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/stochproc) research group, supervised under Prof.
[David Bolin](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/david-bolin').

Before starting my PhD, I got a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [Wenzhou-Kean University](https://www.kean.edu/wku),
and my M.S degree in Statistics at KAUST.

My research interests include `Statistical computing`, `non-Gaussian processes`, `Markov Chain Monte Carlo`.
